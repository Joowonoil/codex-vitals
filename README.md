## Overview

**Codex Vitals** helps you monitor OpenAI Codex usage, reset windows, account state, and workspaces from the macOS menu bar or Windows system tray. When you choose an account, the same local Codex sign-in is applied to Codex CLI and the supported desktop app on that platform.

- View best-effort Codex quota and usage across all your accounts
- Group accounts by workspace/team
- Add local display aliases so personal accounts are easy to identify
- Reorder accounts manually from the row context menu
- Instantly see which account is active
- Switch the active account used by Codex CLI and the desktop app with one click
- Enable Launch at Login from the settings panel
- Tune automatic refresh cadence from the settings panel
- Check for signed app updates and enable automatic installation
- Identify invalid or deactivated accounts

> **Disclaimer:** Codex Vitals is not affiliated with OpenAI. It does not change Codex/OpenAI limits, share accounts, or automate account cycling. It only helps you view local usage state and manually switch between accounts you control.

## Features

- **Codex Quota Dashboard** — Best-effort usage tracking across all linked accounts
- **Workspace Grouping** — Accounts organized by team/workspace
- **Display Aliases** — Local-only account labels for easier scanning while preserving the real email for auth and copy actions
- **Account Health** — Visual indicators for invalid or deactivated accounts
- **One-Click Switching** — Apply a saved account to Codex CLI and the supported desktop app
- **Passive Auth Mirroring** — Codex-managed token rotations are mirrored back into saved local profiles
- **Local-First** — All data stays on your machine; no cloud sync
- **Secure Token Storage** — Sensitive files written with `0600` permissions
- **Settings Panel** — Manage Launch at Login, usage refresh, and application updates inside the menu bar popover
- **Signed Automatic Updates** — Sparkle on macOS and WinSparkle on direct Windows builds verify EdDSA signatures before installation
- **Network-Friendly Refresh** — Automatic usage refresh defaults to 10 minutes, metadata is cached, and account requests are throttled
- **Smart Ordering** — Accounts are implicitly ranked by a composite score so the "best account to use now" surfaces to the top

## Check, Switch, and Continue

Codex Vitals is designed for using several accounts in rotation without losing track of your work:

1. **Check remaining usage** — Compare the quota left on every saved account and find one with capacity.
2. **Press the switch button** — Choose that account directly from the menu bar list.
3. **Use it in the CLI and desktop app** — The selected account becomes active for new Codex CLI runs and for ChatGPT on macOS or Codex Desktop on Windows.
4. **Continue the same conversation** — Session history is stored locally, so `/resume` or `codex resume` can reopen earlier work even after the account changes.

The conversation and workspace context remain available, while new requests use the switched account's limits and permissions. Switching is always manual. Codex Vitals backs up the local state before applying the selected profile and relaunches the supported desktop app; a running CLI session may close during the handoff.

## Smart Ordering

Codex Vitals automatically re-orders your accounts so the best one to use right now appears first.

- **Smart score** — Uses the lowest remaining balance among the quota windows currently reported by OpenAI; the account with the highest bottlenecked balance wins.
- **Priority strip** — Accounts with useful balance whose weekly window resets in less than 24 hours get a temporary urgency boost and appear in a dedicated top section.
- **Exhausted accounts** — Sorted by who resets first, so you know which one will be usable again soonest.
- **Free reset group** — Free-plan accounts waiting for session reset are grouped separately so daily-use paid/workspace accounts stay easier to scan.

## Requirements

- **macOS:** macOS 13 or newer; ChatGPT installed as `ChatGPT.app`, or the legacy `Codex.app`
- **Windows:** 64-bit Windows 10 or 11; Codex Desktop for desktop-session switching
- A Codex CLI installation and accounts you control

## Installation

### macOS

Download the latest `.pkg` from [Releases](../../releases), double-click to run the installer, and Codex Vitals will be installed to `/Applications`.

### Windows

Download [`CodexVitals-Windows-1.0.0-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/Joowonoil/codex-vitals/releases/download/windows-v1.0.0/CodexVitals-Windows-1.0.0-Setup.exe) and run it. The current direct installer is not Authenticode-signed, so Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may show a warning. Choose **More info** and **Run anyway** only for the installer downloaded from this repository or [ramterstudio.com](https://ramterstudio.com/codex-vitals/).

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joowonoil/codex-vitals.git
cd codex-vitals
swift test
swift build
./build-app.sh
open dist/CodexVitals.app
```

### Building the Installer

To generate a `.pkg` installer from the built app:

```bash
./build-app.sh
./build-pkg.sh
```

The installer will be created at `dist/CodexVitals-<version>.pkg`.

Windows build and installer instructions are in [windows/README.md](windows/README.md).

Sparkle release feeds are generated after a signed and notarized DMG is ready:

```bash
scripts/prepare-sparkle-update.sh <version> dist/CodexVitals-<version>.dmg [release-notes.md]
```

## Data & Privacy

Codex Vitals is local-first and never syncs tokens or exposes a remote service.

### Local Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/accounts.json` | Account list |
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/profiles/<profile>/auth.json` | Profile tokens |
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/profiles/<profile>/meta.json` | Profile metadata |
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/accounts-snapshot.json` | Usage snapshots |
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/team-name-cache.json` | Team name cache |
| `~/Library/Application Support/CodexVitals/backups/<timestamp>-remove-account/` | Backups before removal |
| `%APPDATA%\CodexVitals\` | Windows accounts, snapshots, settings, and local backups |

All sensitive files are written with `0600` permissions. Removal actions create backups before deleting profile data.

### Network Calls

The app uses your local Codex/OpenAI auth tokens to query:

- `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/usage`
- `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/accounts/check/v4-2023-04-27`
- `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize`
- `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token`
- `https://ramterstudio.com/codex-vitals/appcast.xml` for application update metadata
- `https://ramterstudio.com/codex-vitals/windows-appcast.xml` for direct Windows update metadata
- GitHub Releases for signed application update downloads

These are not official public APIs and may change without notice.

Automatic usage refresh defaults to 10 minutes. Account metadata is cached for 6 hours during automatic refreshes, while manual refresh always requests fresh usage and metadata.

Application update checks are separate from account refreshes. Sparkle and WinSparkle check at most once every 24 hours by default, and automatic checks can be changed in Settings. Microsoft Store builds leave updates to the Store.

### Security

- Bearer tokens are never logged or transmitted to third parties
- OAuth callback server binds only to `localhost:1455` and closes immediately after login
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model

## FAQ

### Does Codex Vitals work with OpenAI Codex?

Yes. Codex Vitals is built for local OpenAI Codex account usage visibility and manual account switching on macOS and Windows.

### Does it track Codex quota and reset windows?

It shows best-effort Codex usage and reset timing from the local app using your existing Codex/OpenAI auth state. The underlying endpoints are not official public APIs and may change.

### Does it switch Codex accounts automatically?

No. Codex Vitals does not automate account cycling. It only changes the active local Codex account after an explicit manual action.

### Does account switching work in both the CLI and desktop app?

Yes. Check which account still has capacity, press its switch button, and Codex Vitals applies it to new Codex CLI runs and to ChatGPT on macOS or Codex Desktop on Windows.

### Will switching accounts remove my Codex sessions?

No. Session history remains stored locally, so earlier conversations can be reopened with `/resume` or `codex resume` after switching. The conversation continues, while new requests run under the account that is active when the session is resumed.

### Does it upload tokens or account data?

No. Codex Vitals is local-first and does not sync tokens, account data, or usage snapshots to a third-party service.
